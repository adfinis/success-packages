This folder contains three Vault docker-compose files for convenience (and to use during the workshops).

Run the files with alternative names by using the `-f` flag `docker compose -f docker-compose-server.yml up`.

| File name                     | Goal                                   |
|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| docker-compose.yml            | Community Vault running in dev mode    |
| docker-compose-server.yml     | Community Vault running in server mode |
| docker-compose-enterprise.yml | Enterprise Vault running in dev mode   |
